# comparable_candidates.py
"""
This module provides a framework for identifying and ranking comparable candidates 
based on feature similarity and other aspects of proximity based on domain knowledge. 

The original code for comparable_candidates.py for home price prediction is omitted due to ip issue.

For example, Users should implement their own:
1. Data preprocessing and filtering.
2. Comparable candidates metrics and similarity functions (as mentioned in the paper).
3. Candidate retrieval and ranking mechanisms.
